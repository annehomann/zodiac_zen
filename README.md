Zodiac Zen is my first CLI written in python and is to be assessed as our first python assignment for the [Coder Academy](https://coderacademy.edu.au/) Cyber Security bootcamp.  

It's a fun, little app that works out what your star sign is and also what your daily horoscope says. If it's a good one, you can even save it to a text file ☺️

In time, this will be refined with more features and refactored code.
